This repository hosts the theses that I authored in my studies of physics and mathematics.
## (B.Sc.) "Physical and Geometrical Viewpoints of the Korteweg de Vries Equation"
Summarising work in the intersection of late 19th century physics (of *D. D. J. Korteweg* and *D. G. de Vries*) and late 20th century math.
The physical system is a quickly propagating water wave (approx. horse-speed) in a water that needs to be *shallow*.
The mathematical description builds upon *Hamiltonian flows* brought forward by *U. Pinkall*.

## (M.Sc.) "On Topological Quantum Field Theories - A Conversation Between Physics & Mathematics"
Mainly (but not only) summarising work aiming to guide the modern physicist towards **Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs)**.
The chapters comprise:
- Classical *Chern-Simons theory* in the principal bundle setup of mathematical gauge theory.
Some *Wess-Zumino-Witten boundary theory* correspondence appears.
- Anomalies of some well-known quantum field theories.
There is a good reason why they are discussed (namely their topologicality)!
We take a brief look at *anomaly inflow* here as well.
