This repository hosts the theses that I authored in my studies of physics and mathematics.
## (B.Sc.) "Physical and Geometrical Viewpoints of the Korteweg de Vries Equation"
Summarising work in the intersection of late 19th century physics (of *D. D. J. Korteweg* and *D. G. de Vries*) and late 20th century math.
The physical system is a quickly propagating water wave (approx. horse-speed) in a water canal that needs to be *shallow*.
The mathematical description builds upon *Hamiltonian flows* brought forward by *U. Pinkall*.

## (M.Sc.) "On Topological Quantum Field Theories - A Conversation Between Physics & Mathematics"
Mainly (but not only) summarising work aiming to guide the modern physicist towards **Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs)**.
The chapters comprise:
- Classical `Chern-Simons theory` in the principal bundle setup of mathematical gauge theory.
Some *Wess-Zumino-Witten boundary theory* correspondence appears.
- `Anomalies` of some well-known quantum field theories.
There is a good reason why they are discussed (namely their topologicality)!
I take a brief look at `anomaly inflow` here as well.
- A gentle build-up towards TQFTs.
I discuss the function (functor) that assigns to actual ribbons (i.e. bands) some numbers, namely their invariants.
Ribbons carry great importance in *E. Witten*'s paper on the Jones Polynomial that inspired most of this work, because framed Wilson lines are nothing else than ribbons.
At the end, a definition of a `modular category` appears.
- The mathematical zenith of the thesis is the construction of two 3D TQFTs: `State-Sum` & `Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT`.
- Finally, there are some recent applications of these TQFTs.
My professors *C. Schweigert* & *I. Runkel* et al.'s correlator construction of `rational conformal field theories` as 3D cobodordisms.
I.e. a prescription on how to build a 3D object (manifold with some decorations) that can be fed into the TQFT to produce a given n-point function (of the fields from a rational, and conformal quantum field theory).
- Appendices touch the following subjects: The category Cob(d); Mathematical gauge theory; Canonicality of guage theories; "Ribbon = framed Link"; higher form symmetries and 2-groups.
