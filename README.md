## (B.Sc.) "Physical and Geometrical Viewpoints of the Korteweg de Vries Equation"
Summarising work in the intersection of late 19th century physics (of *D. D. J. Korteweg* and *D. G. de Vries*) and late 20th century math.
The physical system is a quickly propagating water wave (approx. horse-speed) in a water that needs to be *shallow*.
The mathematical description builds upon *Hamiltonian flows* brought forward by *U. Pinkall*.
